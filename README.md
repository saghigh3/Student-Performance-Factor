In this Google Colab notebook I investigated the factors impacting student academic performance, with the goal of predicting exam scores. Initial steps involved loading, exploring, and visualizing the dataset to understand relationships between various factors and exam scores. Regression models were then employed to identify key influences and predict exam scores, while statistically insignificant features were removed to enhance model accuracy. The performance of the final predictive model was evaluated using appropriate error metrics.
